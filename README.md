<h1>Discussions in Digital Humanities</h1>
<p>c **Contract of the Web:**
After reading Principles 5 and 8 and listening to Eli Pariser’s TED Talk, I found his insights on algorithmic personalization very eye-opening. Platforms like Google, Facebook, and Instagram often show users only what aligns with their existing interests, which limits exposure to diverse viewpoints and important global issues. Principles 5 and 8 emphasize transparency, data control, and responsible data collection—values that should be standard across all platforms. Clear explanations of how user data is processed and accessible control panels would ensure privacy and trust. Greater transparency would help users engage with both personal and trending information, promoting awareness of the wider world rather than reinforcing online echo chambers.

**Anatomy of an AI System:**
Before reading this article, I didn’t realize how complex and resource-intensive AI systems are. The piece highlighted how interconnected natural resources, human labor, and data are in building AI tools like Alexa. While such technology is convenient, I’m concerned about growing human dependence and the potential for AI to become overly autonomous or intrusive. Despite these risks, AI remains an essential tool that requires careful management and ethical oversight.

**The Internet’s Own Boy:**
This film powerfully depicted Aaron Swartz’s fight for open access to knowledge and the tragic consequences of government overreach. His story revealed flaws in the justice system and highlighted the need for free, ethical access to information. Swartz’s legacy—through Reddit, JSTOR, and Aaron’s Law—continues to inspire advocacy for digital freedom, transparency, and the right to learn without limitation.
