<h1>Discussions in Digital Humanities</h1>
<p>Discussion 1- Contract of the Web- After reading upon both principles 5 and 8 and having listened to Eli Pariser's TED talk, having hearing from Pariser's own viewpoint on how personal data and interaction with online platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Google, etc, have implemented their own algorithemetic personalisation for its respective user. While it may be beneficial for some internet users, as Eli stated it blinds us from the news and knowledge of the world that 'we need to understand rather than what we want to understand.'

I find this very descriptive in terms of how certain platforms isolate us to certain criteria that while we may consistently search on a frequent basis, is based on our own human interests and to not have any implementations to introduce us to trending topics or daily rotated news pieces or articles that may peak our interests to something more exclusive and intrguing to learn more about  rather than the algorithmetic norm certain platforms use to disguise the more crucial information every human's self-interest are ignited by.

In relation to principles 5 and 8, they both possess very reasonable measures and viewpoints that should be implemented more into the introductory software of internet platforms such as Google, such as providing clear explanations of processes affecting people's data, provide control panels where users manage their own data and minimize data collection on what is relevant or irrelevant. These measures in particular I find would be more beneficial to the user, that their data and information is safely secure and not displayed to the general public or used as a means of display to promote the websites own 'positive outlook' from its users. 

Many platforms in today's world must become more transparent to their online communities so that they can be trusted with what relevant information is necessary for the platform's own policies and principles, that they coincide with each other and that overall every user has access to all forms of media, both personal and trending that could be useful for their own basic human knowledge and self-awareness of what is happening both in the real world and the digital world.

Discussion 2 - Responses to Anatomy of an AI System- At first, before viewing this article, I was somewhat uncertain as to how technology and its internal functions would properly be conducted into running a smooth, consistent and reliable means of technological aid for its respective user.  However, after reading upon the article, I found it very intriguing as too how much detail, effort and precision is put into the foundations of an AI or Internet-sourced product. The Sierpinski Triangle offers a glimpse into the repetitive patterns and techniques required to ensure its natural resources and reliability can coincide with one another 24/7 either on an online or offline status.  In my opinion, it its vital to represent how an internet/AI reliant product such as Alexa, gains its origin of information both factually and independently, and to ensure it is safely enabled to only listen in on its respective users requests, questions, etc. ,which is why it is deemed as one of the most convenient forms of household technology. However, my only concern for the rapid rise in the usage of AI or internet sourced products is that the human race could potentially become over-reliant on its fast paced response time and guaranteed answers, regardless of the subject being asked. Secondly, another concern of mine is that the internet based machines could potentially be growing evermore smarter, self-conscious and can begin listening in on the revolving conversations human-to-human. I do believe that AI could become a hazard at times with regards to videos/photos seen in the media, in schools, etc, but I do solemnly think that there will need to be more management, technological effort and accuracy required for it to become a more global concern, as it mainly offers assistance rather than danger to others. In conclusion, I found this article very interesting and detailed to its very last wire and I do very much look forward to the never-ending change to the world of technology we live in today.

Discussion 3- The Internet's Own Boy-This film represents the mismanagement of public information and unprofessional practices, carried out by the four  corners of the US Government, especially with the extreme measures and mistreatment of Aaron Swartz, not just on his mental state , but his own beliefs of the basic human right to read information publicly and freely online without any consequences . As I watched this film, I was amazed by how at such a young age, Aaron was able to achieve so much at the ages of 12-13 that many young IT enthusiast's can only dream of and to not only offer people a deeper insight into exploring information and reading articles online, but also give people the rights and opportunities to dive deeper into the digital world, be able to study and relish in their chosen fields and to not have to be limited to the physical media that was considered one-sided and biased during the early 2000's.

Listening to the close friends, family and attorneys who believed in Aaron Swartz's ideas obviously were deeply saddened and moved by his death, not just because of the pressures of the courts filings, arrest warrants and jail time being pushed up time and time again, but the fact that he was upheld and wrongly accused of downloading online files for his own self-interest, however this wasn't his true intention. His true intentions were always for the betterment of those around him in his work environment and throughout the digital world, that their voices were heard & that what the government were originally trying to do with the public's own personal information was wrong and completely unethical. I found it truly upsetting and disgusting that Aaron was being made as an example by the punishing court that he was labelled as some fraud or faulty hacker, when throughout his whole life, it is stated that he just wanted to do right by the people, for the truth to be told and that he made a good impact on the world around him.  His death was a shock to the whole world, a young man with the idea to go beyond the basic fundamentals of computing and gaining information without limitation or scrutiny. He had a lot of silent battles caused by the disappointing justice system that is still being questioned to this day, Aaron was a soldier willing to do whatever it takes so that the people could speak freely, gain information freely and to live a life where learning goes beyond limitation, he was a soldier who got caught in the crossfire, who had to bite the bullet time and time again and should never be forgotten for his uncompromising stand for the right to learn freely and go beyond the basics.

His impact on the digital world will never be forgotten, with the presence of Reddit and JSTOR still operating today and the newly abided 'Aaron's Law' will be a testament to his passion and dedication to never be limited to the one book title,  to be able to learn without stoppage and to be able to voice your opinions on how to make the digital world a safer, more reliable and transparent society.  A truly great mentor and example who will never be forgotten.
